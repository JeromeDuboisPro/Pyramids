# Pyramids - Project Status

## Current Phase
**Phase 1: MVP** ✅ COMPLETE

## Project Overview
Minimalist RTS game with light-based mechanics. Built with Three.js, featuring energy transfer between spheres with distance attenuation.

## Core Mechanics (All Implemented)
- Click sphere → click target → create connection
- Energy transfer with inverse square attenuation
- Gradual color interpolation (stepped at 25/50/75% thresholds)
- One connection per sphere (strategic constraint)
- Victory condition: All spheres owned by player

## Visual Systems
1. **Cellular Plasma Spheres** - Procedural texture with rotation tied to energy level
2. **Particle Streams** - Energy transfer visualization with trails and impact effects
3. **Starfield Background** - 150 twinkling stars with painting system
4. **Color Trails** - 4 persistent colored trails that paint stars (cyan/pink/yellow/mint)
5. **Camera System** - Pan (middle-click), rotate (right-click), zoom (scroll), reset button

## Theme System
5 color schemes available:
- Default (cyan/orange)
- Sunset (warm tones)
- Forest (green/brown)
- Ocean (blue/teal)
- Neon (bright colors)

## Technical Architecture
- ES6 modules with clean separation
- Entity-based system (Sphere, GameState)
- Renderer pattern (SceneManager, SphereRenderer, StreamRenderer, StarfieldRenderer)
- Input abstraction (mouse + touch unified)
- Performance optimized (texture caching, LOD considerations)

## Performance Targets
✅ 60 FPS on mid-range hardware
✅ Runs on integrated GPUs
✅ Mobile touch support

## Known Limitations
- Single static level (7 spheres in circle)
- No AI opponent yet
- No level progression system
- No save/load functionality

## Roadmap Position
**Next**: Phase 2 - Puzzle Campaign (10-15 levels with progression system)
**Decision Point**: Requires 5+ user playtests before proceeding
